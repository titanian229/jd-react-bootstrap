    "Hello, I'm James Lee. I'm a full stack web developer, based in Toronto. I'm focused on clean, efficient, and easily expandable code.",

    "I first encountered programming by exploring it myself, creating software to automate my life and work and improve the things I encountered day to day. Mapping and planning the routes I kayak, automating the bulky process of creating GCal events around work schedules, android applications to take my software on the go with me. I taught myself by exploring documentation, picking things apart and playing with new ways to code and new design patterns. I found my passion in it. I’m always growing my skill set taking online and physical classes, most recently a University of Toronto coding bootcamp."
